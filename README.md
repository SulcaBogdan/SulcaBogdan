<h2 align="left">Education:</h2>
<p align="left">
      As a self-taught software developer, I have completed a year-long Java online school at LINK ACADEMY and received a certificate as a Java developer. I continued to expand my knowledge and skills and learned Python, including its features such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Pandas, Numpy, working with data structures like Lists/Tuples/Dicitonaries/Sets and optimizing algorithms by learning time complexity and understanding Big O notation, ensuring my code is efficient and scalable. With these technologies and tools, I have been able to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

<h2 align="left">Experience:</h2>
<h3>HARP SOFTWARE INTERNSHIP</h3>

Cross-trained in **Python** and **Java**, and well-versed in cloud technologies with a strong emphasis on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Developed the understanding of time complexity, allowing for optimized coding solutions and improved algorithm performance. Expertise in Python data analysis with pandas and numpy transforms raw data into valuable insights, driving strategic decisions. Trained in the use of Apache Beam, an advanced tool for batch and stream data processing, enabling data transformation, transportation, and loading. Gained hands-on experience with cloud technologies, specifically the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), including practical exposure to BigQuery for large-scale data analysis and Dataflow for data pipeline creation.

<h2 align="left">Progamming languages:</h2>

### Java
Proficient in all four principles of OOP (inheritance / polymorphism / abstraction / encapsulation). Use appropriate algorithms for each type of problem, employ all data structures (HashMap/Set arrays, List, etc.), and understand the functionality and power of this language. Utilize Apache Beam for creating pipelines for the flow of data from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, leading to the final process of consumption - transformation - storage - release.

### Python
Proficient in all principles of OOP. Use suitable algorithms for each type of problem, employ all data structures (Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), and understand the functionality and power of this language. Use pandas/numpy for reading and processing data in the most efficient way.

### SQL
Proficient in high-level syntax. Perform data selection, conditioning, and transformation/aggregation using the most efficient syntax. Use indexing for the fastest search.


## About me: 

<p align="left"> I'm a 26-year-old living in Romania and i am passionate about technology.

I'm an honest and straight forward individual who believes in doing things the right way. I don't cut corners, and I strive for perfection in everything I do. I like to maintain an organized and clean workspace, which is a reflection of how I write code. My dream is to become a proficient developer, to utilize my creativity and spontaneous ideas to create something original and meaningful for the world. I strive to evolve mentally, spiritually, and physically, making everything I do about personal growth.

I believe anything is possible, and I'm willing to do everything in my power to achieve my goals. The programming industry offers endless possibilities for creativity, and I'm eager to learn as much as I can to become a valuable contributor to the field. I want to work alongside some of the most innovative minds and companies and learn from them to grow both personally and professionally. Ultimately, my aim is to make a positive impact on the world through the power of technology.
